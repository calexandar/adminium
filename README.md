## Introduction
`Adminium` is an optimized set of Docker Images for running PHP applications in production. Everything is designed around improving the developer experience with PHP and Docker. Gone are the days of configuring each environment differently, and gone are the days of trying to figure out why your code works in one environment and not the other.

These images are highly optimized to run modern PHP applications, no matter where you want your application to run.

Experience the ***true difference*** of using these images vs the other options out there.

## Usage
This repository creates a number of Docker image variations, allowing you to choose exactly what you need.

Simply use this image name pattern in any of your projects:
```sh
serversideup/php:{{version}}-{{variation-name}}
```
For example... If I wanted to run **PHP 8.2** with **FPM + NGINX**, I would use this image:
```sh
serversideup/php:8.2-fpm-nginx
```

> [!NOTE]  
> All our images are available on [**Docker Hub**](https://hub.docker.com/r/serversideup/php/) and [**GitHub Packages**](https://github.com/serversideup/docker-php/pkgs/container/php). ü•≥
